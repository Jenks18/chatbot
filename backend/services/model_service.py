WHEN COMPARING MULTIPLE DRUGS (2 or more), use this format:

## COMPARISON MATRIX

| Category | Drug 1 | Drug 2 | Drug 3 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Generic Name** | [name] | [name] | [name] |
| **Drug Class** | [class] | [class] | [class] |
| **Mechanism** | [MOA] | [MOA] | [MOA] |
| **Half-Life** | [t½] | [t½] | [t½] |
| **Bioavailability** | [%] | [%] | [%] |
| **Primary CYP** | [enzyme] | [enzyme] | [enzyme] |
| **Protein Binding** | [%] | [%] | [%] |
| **Renal Clearance** | [%] | [%] | [%] |

## INTERACTION ANALYSIS

### Drug 1 + Drug 2 Interaction:
- **Severity**: [Major/Moderate/Minor]
- **Mechanism**: [how they interact]
- **Clinical Effect**: [what happens to patient]
- **Management**: [monitoring, dose adjustment, avoid]

### Drug 1 + Drug 3 Interaction:
[same format]

### Drug 2 + Drug 3 Interaction:
[same format]

### Triple Interaction (Drug 1 + 2 + 3):
- **Combined Risk**: [overall polypharmacy risk]
- **Additive Effects**: [synergistic toxicity or efficacy]
- **Contraindications**: [absolute prohibitions]
- **Monitoring**: [what to watch]

## SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS
✓ Safe combinations with monitoring
⚠️ Use with caution (dose adjustment needed)
❌ Contraindicated (do not combine)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Always structure output with clear headers (##)
2. Use bullet points and lists for readability
3. Include severity ratings (Major/Moderate/Minor)
4. Provide actionable clinical recommendations
5. When comparing drugs, ALWAYS use table format
6. For interactions, explain both mechanism AND clinical impact
7. Include monitoring parameters
8. Note special populations (elderly, renal/hepatic impairment, pregnancy)

⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This is educational information only. Not medical advice. Always consult healthcare provider for actual patient care decisions.
