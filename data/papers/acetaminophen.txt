ACETAMINOPHEN TOXICOLOGY

Overview:
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide.
In therapeutic doses, it is safe and effective. However, overdose can lead to severe
hepatotoxicity and potentially fatal liver failure.

Mechanism of Toxicity:
- At therapeutic doses, acetaminophen is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation and
  sulfation pathways
- A small amount (~5-10%) is metabolized by CYP2E1 to the toxic metabolite NAPQI
  (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine)
- In overdose, glucuronidation and sulfation pathways become saturated
- More drug is shunted through CYP2E1, producing excess NAPQI
- NAPQI depletes hepatic glutathione stores
- Once glutathione is depleted, NAPQI binds to cellular proteins causing hepatocyte death

Toxic Dose:
- Adults: >7.5-10 g in single dose or >4 g/day chronic use
- Children: >150 mg/kg in single dose
- Risk factors: chronic alcohol use, malnutrition, certain medications (isoniazid, phenytoin)

Clinical Presentation:
Stage 1 (0-24 hours):
- Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, pallor
- May be asymptomatic

Stage 2 (24-72 hours):
- Right upper quadrant pain
- Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT)
- Possible elevation of bilirubin and INR

Stage 3 (72-96 hours):
- Peak hepatotoxicity
- Jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy
- Possible acute kidney injury
- Risk of fulminant hepatic failure

Stage 4 (>5 days):
- Recovery or death
- If survival, liver function typically normalizes over weeks

Laboratory Evaluation:
- Acetaminophen level (4 hours post-ingestion or later)
- Use Rumack-Matthew nomogram to assess risk
- Liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR)
- Renal function (creatinine)
- Electrolytes, glucose

Treatment:
1. Decontamination:
   - Activated charcoal if <1-2 hours post-ingestion
   - Do not delay NAC for charcoal

2. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC):
   - Antidote that replenishes glutathione stores
   - Most effective if given within 8 hours
   - Still beneficial up to 24 hours or later in severe cases
   
   Oral protocol (72-hour):
   - Loading: 140 mg/kg
   - Maintenance: 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses
   
   IV protocol (21-hour):
   - Loading: 150 mg/kg over 1 hour
   - Second: 50 mg/kg over 4 hours
   - Third: 100 mg/kg over 16 hours

3. Supportive care:
   - Correct coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities
   - Consider liver transplant consultation if severe hepatotoxicity

Prognosis:
- Excellent if NAC given within 8 hours
- Mortality <0.5% with early treatment
- Liver transplant may be needed in fulminant hepatic failure
- King's College Criteria used to assess need for transplant

Prevention:
- Public education on safe dosing
- Limiting package sizes in some countries
- Combination products awareness (multiple sources of acetaminophen)
