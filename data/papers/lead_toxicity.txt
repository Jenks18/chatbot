LEAD TOXICOLOGY AND POISONING

Overview:
Lead is a heavy metal that has been used for thousands of years in various applications.
Despite reduction in environmental exposure, lead poisoning remains a significant public
health concern, particularly in children and occupationally exposed adults.

Sources of Exposure:
1. Environmental:
   - Lead-based paint in older homes (pre-1978)
   - Contaminated soil and dust
   - Lead water pipes and plumbing fixtures
   - Industrial emissions

2. Occupational:
   - Battery manufacturing
   - Construction and demolition
   - Firing ranges
   - Lead smelting and mining
   - Radiator repair

3. Other:
   - Imported ceramics and pottery with lead glaze
   - Traditional remedies (azarcon, greta)
   - Retained bullets
   - Lead-contaminated moonshine

Toxicokinetics:
Absorption:
- Oral absorption: 10-15% in adults, up to 50% in children
- Increased on empty stomach and with iron/calcium deficiency
- Inhalation absorption: ~90% of inhaled particles <2.5 μm

Distribution:
- Blood lead level (BLL) represents only 1-2% of body burden
- 95% stored in bone (half-life ~20-30 years)
- Crosses placenta and blood-brain barrier
- Mobilized from bone during pregnancy, lactation, menopause

Excretion:
- Primarily renal (75%)
- Also in bile, sweat, hair, nails
- Half-life in blood: ~30-40 days
- Half-life in bone: decades

Mechanism of Toxicity:
1. Heme Synthesis Inhibition:
   - Inhibits δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD)
   - Inhibits ferrochelatase
   - Results in anemia and elevated protoporphyrin

2. Neurological Effects:
   - Disrupts calcium-dependent neurotransmission
   - Increases oxidative stress
   - Damages myelin
   - Interferes with neurodevelopment in children

3. Renal Effects:
   - Proximal tubular damage
   - Interstitial fibrosis
   - Decreased glomerular filtration

4. Reproductive Effects:
   - Decreased sperm count and motility
   - Increased spontaneous abortion
   - Preterm birth

Clinical Manifestations:

Children:
- Often asymptomatic with mild-moderate elevation
- Developmental delays
- Learning disabilities
- Behavioral problems
- Decreased IQ (no safe threshold identified)
- High levels: encephalopathy, seizures, coma

Adults:
Low-level chronic exposure:
- Fatigue, irritability
- Headaches
- Decreased concentration
- Hypertension
- Nephropathy
- Reproductive effects

High-level exposure:
- Abdominal colic (lead colic)
- Peripheral neuropathy (wrist drop, foot drop)
- Encephalopathy
- Anemia

Diagnosis:
Blood Lead Level (BLL):
- Reference level (CDC): ≥3.5 μg/dL (children), ≥5 μg/dL (adults)
- Symptomatic toxicity: usually >40-60 μg/dL
- Encephalopathy: typically >100 μg/dL

Ancillary Tests:
- Complete blood count (microcytic anemia)
- Peripheral smear (basophilic stippling)
- Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) or free erythrocyte protoporphyrin
- Renal function tests
- Abdominal X-ray (lead foreign bodies, paint chips)
- Long bone X-rays in children (lead lines)

Treatment:

Environmental Intervention:
- Identify and eliminate source (MOST IMPORTANT)
- Home inspection and lead hazard control
- Nutritional optimization (iron, calcium, vitamin C)

Chelation Therapy:

Indications:
- BLL ≥45 μg/dL in children
- BLL ≥70-80 μg/dL in adults
- Symptomatic patients at lower levels
- Encephalopathy at any level

Agents:

1. Succimer (DMSA):
   - Oral chelator
   - Drug of choice for children
   - Dose: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days, then every 12 hours for 14 days

2. EDTA (CaNa2EDTA):
   - IV chelator
   - Dose: 1000-1500 mg/m²/day
   - Used in moderate-severe poisoning

3. Dimercaprol (BAL):
   - IM chelator
   - Used in severe poisoning/encephalopathy
   - Often combined with EDTA
   - Dose: 3-5 mg/kg every 4 hours

4. D-Penicillamine:
   - Oral chelator
   - Third-line agent
   - More adverse effects than succimer

Severe Poisoning Protocol:
- BLL >70 μg/dL or encephalopathy
- BAL 75 mg/m² IM every 4 hours
- EDTA 1500 mg/m²/day continuous infusion (start 4 hours after BAL)
- Consider exchange transfusion if BLL >150 μg/dL

Monitoring:
- BLL weekly during chelation
- Rebound common (mobilization from bone)
- May require multiple courses
- Long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up in children

Occupational Standards:
OSHA:
- Action level: 30 μg/dL
- Removal level: 50 μg/dL (must remove from exposure)

Prevention:
- Primary prevention (eliminate exposure) most important
- Screen high-risk children (age 1-2 years in high-risk areas)
- Occupational hygiene measures
- Public health interventions (lead paint abatement)

Prognosis:
- Neurological damage in children may be irreversible
- Adults generally better prognosis with exposure cessation
- Renal disease may progress even after chelation
- No safe level of lead exposure in children

Key Points:
1. No safe blood lead level in children
2. Source identification and elimination is crucial
3. Chelation does not reverse neurological damage
4. Children absorb more and are more vulnerable than adults
5. Prevention is the most effective intervention
